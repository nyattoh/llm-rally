A drizzling night in a gravity-defying Tokyo. The asphalt street curves seamlessly upwards, physically bending 90 degrees to become a vertical wall, then arching directly overhead. Not a reflection, but a solid continuous loop of architecture. Iconic buildings and roads protrude perpendicularly from the curved surface all around. Tokyo's landmarks hang upside down above. The text 'ZERO GRAVITY' displays elegantly in the center, large, cinematic, sleek, glowing white sans-serif typography, floating in the air. Below it, the text 'v0.1.0-alpha' appears smaller, glowing softly in a matching style. Realistic lighting matching the weather, vivid details, photorealistic 8k.
